# fillit

The goal of this project is to discover a recurrent problematic in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, in a resonable time.

In this project, it will be a question of arranging Tetriminos between them and to determine the smallest square possible.

A Tetriminos is a geometric figure formed of 4 blockes.
